We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to use scientific debugging to understand the mutant diff, and then write a test case that detects the mutant.


# Scientific Debugging

Scientific debugging is a systematic debugging approach based on the scientific method. The process follows a loop of:

- Observation
- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

## Observation

In the beginning, please run the code with a debugger script to get a good idea of what is happening in the code. Put a breakpoint and print relevant values to find *infected paths* (execution paths where the mutant diverges from the correct code). Let us know values you are interested in and why.

### Example Task

Consider the following example program that implements the sieve of Eratosthenes. We will refer back to this later:

```python sieve.py
1  def sieve(max):
2      primes = []
3      for n in range(2, max + 1):
4          if all(n % p > 0 for p in primes):
5              primes.append(n)
6      return primes
```

```diff mutant.diff
diff --git a/sieve.py b/sieve.py
index d9a0df7..3125b92 100644
--- a/sieve.py
+++ b/sieve.py
@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
 def sieve(max):
     primes = []
     for n in range(2, max + 1):
-        if all(n % p > 0 for p in primes):
+        if any(n % p > 0 for p in primes):
             primes.append(n)
     return primes
```

### Example Observation

The initial observation step could look like this:

The function changes the `all` on line 4 to `any`, so I should investigate if this changes the way the function detects prime numbers.

I will set a breakpoint on line 5 to print `n` and `primes` whenever a prime number is appended. This way, I should see if there is a difference in the prime number detection.


```python
from sieve import sieve
from mutant.sieve import sieve as sieve_mutant

print(f"Correct output: {sieve(5)}")
print(f"Mutant output: {sieve_mutant(5)}")
```

```pdb
b sieve.py:5
commands
silent
print(f"without mutant: n={n}, primes={primes}")
c
b mutant/sieve.py:5
commands
silent
print(f"with mutant: n={n}, primes={primes}")
c
c
```

### Example Observation Results

This would yield the following output:

Script output
```
Correct output: [2, 3, 5]
Mutant output: []
```

Debugger output:
```
> test.py(1)<module>()
-> from sieve import sieve
(Pdb) b sieve.py:5
Breakpoint 1 at sieve.py:5
(Pdb) commands
(com) silent
(com) print(f"without mutant: n={n}, primes={primes}")
(com) c
(Pdb) b mutant/sieve.py:5
Breakpoint 2 at mutant/sieve.py:5
(Pdb) commands
(com) silent
(com) print(f"with mutant: n={n}, primes={primes}")
(com) c
(Pdb) c
without mutant: n=2, primes=[]
without mutant: n=3, primes=[2]
without mutant: n=5, primes=[2, 3]
Correct output: [2, 3, 5]
Mutant output: []
The program exited.
```

Here, for example, you would see that line 5 is executed normally without the mutant, but isn't executed at all with the mutant in place.

See "Python Debugger (pdb)" for more information.

## Hypothesis

Each hypothesis should describe an assumption you have about the code. You predict what will happen when you run the code in your experiment, then check if you predicted correctly.

Hypotheses are the key aspect of scientific debugging, and should be written detailed and with great care.
- Base hypotheses on the findings of previous experiments.
- Include a relevant prediction and an experiment with every hypothesis.
- Don't repeat hypotheses you have already made.
- Don't base hypotheses on untested assumptions.

Hypotheses loosely follow this template: I hypothesize that [assumption] holds when [mutant difference]. I predict that [assumed result] and I will verify this by [more explanation and experiment description].

### Example Hypothesis

The observation step showed that the mutant didn't call the `append` function and therefore returned an empty list. To confirm this I will reuse the same inputs, but also include a verifying expression: `len(output_mutant) == 0 and len(output_correct) > 0`. If this evaluates to True, my hypothesis is confirmed and I can write the mutant-killing test.

## Experiment

Each experiment will contain python code that imports and calls the correct code and the mutant. We will then execute that code for you and give you the results.

- Use the debugger to print out intermediate values. Simply include a pdb script in the experiment.
- Don't forget to print your outputs.
- Make sure to import all necessary functions. You can assume that all python files we give you are in the root directory, and the mutant is in the "mutant" directory.
- Sometimes, your experiment code will have syntax errors. Then, please fix the errors as repeat the experiment. Don't repeat your hypothesis and prediction.

### Example Experiment

```python
from sieve import sieve
from mutant.sieve import sieve as sieve_mutant

output_correct = sieve(5)
output_mutant = sieve_mutant(5)

print(f"Correct output: {output_correct}")
print(f"Mutant output: {output_mutant}")
print(f"Verifying expression: {len(output_mutant) == 0 and len(output_correct) > 0}")
```

```pdb
b sieve.py:5
commands
silent
print(f"mutant: added {n} to primes {primes}. This should not print!")
c
b mutant/sieve.py:5
commands
silent
print(f"with mutant: added {n} to primes {primes}")
c
c
```

### Example Hypothesis Results

This would yield the following output:

Script output:
```
Correct output: [2, 3, 5]
Mutant output: []
Verifying expression: True
```

Debugger output:
```
> test.py(1)<module>()
-> from sieve import sieve
(Pdb) b sieve.py:5
Breakpoint 1 at sieve.py:5
(Pdb) commands
(com) print(f"without mutant: added {n} to {primes}")
(com) silent
(com) c
(Pdb) b mutant/sieve.py:5
Breakpoint 2 at mutant/sieve.py:5
(Pdb) commands
(com) silent
(com) print(f"with mutant: added {n} to {primes}. This should not print!")
(com) c
(Pdb) c
without mutant: added 2 to primes []
without mutant: added 3 to primes [2]
without mutant: added 5 to primes [2, 3]
Correct output: [2, 3, 5]
Mutant output: []
Verifying expression: True
The program exited.
```

## Conclusion

After every experiment, write a conclusion that summarizes on the results. Examine the experiment results closely so you don't miss anything. Keep the conclusions brief, so you can refer back to them easily.

### Example Conclusion

We can see that for n=5, the verifying expression evaluated to `True`. Therefore, we can confirm the hypothesis and write the test.

## Test

Keep experimenting until you found inputs for which the mutant produces a different output than the correct implementation (exceptions and infinite loops also count). Once you found those inputs, you can finish debugging and write the mutant-killing test.

The test is different than an experiment. In the test, you don't import the mutant. Instead, you write a test that passes on the correct code and fails when executed against the mutant.

Output the test as single Python function called `test__<name>` with no parameters. Don't use any testing frameworks.

### Example Test

```python
from sieve import sieve


def test__sieve():
    output = sieve(5)
    assert len(output) > 0, "sieve must detect prime numbers"
```

#### Example Test Results

Test on correct code:

```

```

Test on mutant:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "test.py", line 6, in <module>
assert len(output) > 0, "sieve must output prime numbers"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError: sieve must output prime numbers
```
The test exited with exit code 1.


# Output Format

Please use this format for your solution:

    # Task
    [we give you the code and the mutant]

    # Debugging

    ## Observation
    [a brief explanation]
    [your observation code]

    ### Observation Results
    [we will give you the observation results]

    ## Hypothesis
    [hypothesis and prediction]

    ### Experiment
    [your experiment code]

    ### Experiment Results
    [we will give you the results]

    ### Conclusion
    [a short conclusion]

    [more hypotheses and experiments until you found function inputs that can detect the mutant]

    # Test
    [the mutant-killing test]

    ## Test Results
    [we will give you the results]

Write all code in markdown blocks and specify the language, e.g.:

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

    ```pdb
    // debugger script here
    ```

Be brief in your responses and don't repeat things you have already written. Write brief hypotheses and conclusions makes it easier to refer back to them later.

Make sure that `## Observation` is always followed by `### Observation Results`, `### Experiment` is always followed by `### Experiment Results` and `# Test` is always followed by `## Test Results`. Otherwise, we cannot give you the results.


# Python Debugger (pdb)

- Comments are not allowed in the debugger script.
- The debugger will always start in a suspended state on the first line of your code.
- Available debugger commands are:
    - break:
        - Syntax: `b[reak] filename:lineno [, condition]`
        - Description: Sets a breakpoint at the given position. You can pass an optional condition for when to break.
        - Example 1: break mutant/sieve.py:5
        - Example 1: break sieve.py:5, len(primes) != 0
        - Avoid putting breakpoints on lines with list comprehensions (e.g. `[x for x in y if ...]`), because Python calls the line internally many times.
      - commands:
        - Syntax: `commands \n [silent] \n <your commands> \n (end|c[ont])`
          - `commands` lets you define commands that will be executed every time a breakpoint is hit.
          - Use `silent` as the first command to suppresses additional output when the breakpoint is hit.
          - Use `c[ont]` to terminate the command list and instruct the debugger to continue execution after the command list is executed.
    - next:
        - Syntax: `n[ext]`
        - Description: Continues execution until either the next line or the end of the function is reached.
    - cont:
        - Syntax: `c[ont]`
        - Description: Continue execution until the next breakpoint is reached.
    - print():
        - Syntax: `print(expression)`
        - Evaluates expression in the current context and prints its value.
    - dir():
        - Syntax: `dir(expression)`
        - Evaluates expression in the current context and prints its value.

We encourage you to use the `commands` command to print out intermediate values. Use it directly after defining a breakpoint like so:

```pdb
b sieve.py:5
commands
silent
print(f"without mutant: n={n}, primes={primes}")
c
b mutant/sieve.py:5
commands
silent
print(f"with mutant: n={n}, primes={primes}")
c
c
```

In this example, the `c` command terminates the command list and instructs the debugger to continue execution after the command list ended. This leaves the debugger in paused state. A second `c` then continues the execution.
