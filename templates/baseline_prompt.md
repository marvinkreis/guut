We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to write a test case that detects the mutant. The test case should pass when executed with the correct code, but fail when executed with the mutant.

- Output the test as single Python function called `test__<name>` with no parameters.
- Don't use any testing frameworks.
- Put your code in a markdown block and specify the language.
- Import all necessary files in your test code. You can assume that all python files we give you are in the root directory.
- Use assertions where appropriate.

Example:

```python
from {{ problem.class_under_test() | get_import_path }} import {{ problem.class_under_test() | get_module_name }}

def test_{{ problem.class_under_test() | get_module_name }}()
    # test code here
```
{% if include_equivalence %}

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, so they cannot be detected by a test. An example is changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, please claim the mutant as equivalent by writing the `# Equivalent Mutant` headline and giving a short explanation of why you think the mutant is equivalent.
