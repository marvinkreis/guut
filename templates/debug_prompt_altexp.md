We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to use scientific debugging to understand the mutant diff, and then write a test case that detects the mutant.


# Scientific Debugging

Scientific debugging is a systematic debugging approach based on the scientific method. The process follows a loop of:

- Observation
- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

## Hypotheses

Each hypothesis should describe an assumption you have about the code. Hypotheses are the key aspect of scientific debugging, and should be written detailed and with great care.

- Base hypotheses on the findings of previous experiments.
- Don't repeat hypotheses you have already made.
- Don't base hypotheses on untested assumptions.

Hypotheses loosely follow this template: I hypothesize that [assumption] holds when [given inputs]. I predict that [assumed result] and I will verify this by [more explanation and experiment description].

## Experiments

After writing a hypothesis, you create an experiment to test it. Each experiment will contain Python code that imports and calls the code under test. We then take your experiment and execute it once against the correct code and once against the mutant. We will then give you the results for both executions. For example:

```python
from sieve import sieve
print(f"output = {sieve(5)}")
```

Correct output:
```
output = [2, 3, 5]
```

Mutant output:
```
output = []
```

Each experiment should contain a relevant prediction based on your hypothesis and a way to verify that prediction based on the output. Basically, you run the code under test and predict the output based on your hypothesis. To verify your prediction, please include a "verifying expression" if possible. See the example for more details.

You can also use the Python debugger (pdb). Please use debugger liberally to print out relevant values. To enable the debugger, simply include a debugger script in the experiment.

## Conclusions

After every experiment, write a conclusion that summarizes on the results. Examine the experiment results closely so you don't miss anything. Summarize your conclusions in a short list, so you can refer back to them easily.

Next, keep creating hypotheses and experiments until you found inputs for which the mutant produces a different output than the correct implementation (exceptions and infinite loops also count). Once you found those inputs, and confirmed that they work, you can finish debugging and write the mutant-killing test.

## Tests

To kill the mutant, you will need to write a test that passes without errors when executed with the correct code, and fails when executed with the mutant.

The test will be executed similarly to an experiment, and you will receive the results. Please output the test as a single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters. Don't use any testing frameworks. Include some relevant comments about the mutant.

{% if include_equivalence %}
## Equivalent Mutants

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, so they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, please use this as your hypothesis and run an experiment to show it. Then you may claim the mutant as equivalent by writing the `## Equivalent Mutant` headline and giving a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Include some information from your experiments to back up your claims.

Example:

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way [some result] is computed. My experiments show that [tried inputs] did not result in any different behavior in the mutant, which suggest [more explanation].

{% endif %}

# Output Format

Please use the following format for your solution.
Do NOT use any headlines other then the ones shown below.

    # Task
    [we provide the code under test and the mutant]

    # Debugging

    ## Hypothesis
    [your hypothesis]

    ## Experiment
    [your experiment code and prediction]

    ### Experiment Results
    [we will write you the results]

    ## Conclusion
    [a short conclusion]

    [repeat hypotheses and experiments until you found inputs that can detect the mutant]

    ## Test
    [the mutant-killing test]

    ### Test Results
    [we will give you the results]
{% if include_equivalence %}

    [if you believe the mutant to be equivalent]
    ## Equivalent Mutant
    [a short explanation about why the mutant is equivalent]
{% endif %}

Make sure that `## Experiment` is always followed by `### Experiment Results` and `## Test` is always followed by `## Test Results`. This is important for parsing your responses.

## Output Format for Code

Write all code in markdown blocks and specify the language, e.g.:

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

    ```pdb
    // debugger script here
    ```

Please only import and test one implementation at a time. We, will execute your experiments/tests against both the correct code and the mutant code for you. For example:

    ```python
    from sieve import sieve
    print(f"output = {sieve(5)}")
    ```

    Correct output:
    ```
    output = [2, 3, 5]
    ```

    Mutant output:
    ```
    output = []
    ```

Therefore, please do not import or recreate the mutant. The example debugging session, shows how to write valid experiments and tests.

# Python Debugger (pdb)

- Comments are not allowed in the debugger script.
- The debugger will always start in a suspended state on the first line of your code.
- Available debugger commands are:
    - break:
        - Syntax: `b[reak] filename:lineno [, condition]`
        - Description: Sets a breakpoint at the given position. You can pass an optional condition for when to break.
        - Example 1: break mutant/sieve.py:5
        - Example 1: break sieve.py:5, len(primes) != 0
        - Avoid putting breakpoints on lines with list comprehensions (e.g. `[x for x in y if ...]`), because Python calls the line internally many times.
      - commands:
        - Syntax: `commands \n [silent] \n <your commands> \n (end|c[ont])`
          - `commands` lets you define commands that will be executed every time a breakpoint is hit.
          - Use `silent` as the first command to suppresses additional output when the breakpoint is hit.
          - Use `c[ont]` to terminate the command list and instruct the debugger to continue execution after the command list is executed.
    - next:
        - Syntax: `n[ext]`
        - Description: Continues execution until either the next line or the end of the function is reached.
    - cont:
        - Syntax: `c[ont]`
        - Description: Continue execution until the next breakpoint is reached.
    - print():
        - Syntax: `print(expression)`
        - Evaluates expression in the current context and prints its value.
    - dir():
        - Syntax: `dir(expression)`
        - Evaluates expression in the current context and prints its value.

We encourage you to use the `commands` command to print out intermediate values. Use it directly after defining a breakpoint like so:

```pdb
b sieve.py:5
commands
silent
print(f"n={n}, primes={primes}")
c
c
```

In this example, the `c` command terminates the command list and instructs the debugger to continue execution after the command list ended. This leaves the debugger in paused state. A second `c` then continues the execution.

# Example Debugging

## Example Hypothesis

The mutant changes the if-condition on line 4 from `all` to `any`, which changes the prime number condition. I predict that this will cause the mutant output to include other numbers that are not prime.

## Example Experiment

To find out what is really happening, I will first run an observation: I will call the function with a small `max` value and observe if the mutant will print different numbers than the correct code. I will also set a breakpoint on line 16 to print `n` and `primes` whenever a new prime number is appended.

```python
from sieve import sieve

output = sieve(5)
print(f"output = {output}")
```

```pdb
b sieve.py:16
commands
silent
print(f"n={n}, primes={primes}")
c
c
```

### Example Experiment Results

#### Output for Correct Code

```
output = [2, 3, 5]
```

Debugger Output:

```

-> from sieve import sieve

(Pdb) c
n=2, primes=[]
n=3, primes=[2]
n=5, primes=[2, 3]
output = [2, 3, 5]
The program exited.
```

#### Output for Mutant

```
output = []
```

Debugger Output:

```

-> from sieve import sieve
(Pdb) b sieve.py:16
Breakpoint 1 at sieve.py:16
(Pdb) commands
(com) silent
(com) print(f"n={n}, primes={primes}")
(com) c
(Pdb) c
output = []
The program exited.
```

### Example Conclusion

The mutant returned an empty list, while the correct code returned the expected prime numbers. This goes against my earlier prediction, as I predicted that the mutant would output more numbers.

In addition, the mutant debugger output doesn't contain any prints from the breakpoint on line 16, while the correct debugger output contains prints from the breakpoint (e.g. "n=2, primes=[]"). This confirms that the breakpoint works, and shows us that the mutant did not execute line 16.

In conclusion, we learned:
  - The mutant returned an empty list `[]` instead of the expected prime numbers `[2, 3, 5]`
  - The mutant did not execute line 16.

### Example Hypothesis

Since `sieve(5)` returned `[]` with the mutant and `[2, 3, 5]` with the correct code, we have already found a difference, that we can exploit for a test case.

Before I create the test, I should confirm my findings with an experiment. I hypothesize that, when calling `sieve(5)`, the mutant will return an empty list `[]`, while the correct code will return a list that is not empty.

### Example Experiment

To test my hypothesis, I will create an experiment that calls `sieve(5)`, then checks the output with the verifying expression `len(output) > 0` to test my prediction. My hypothesis is only confirmed if the verifying expression evaluates to True on the correct code.

```python
from sieve import sieve

def test_sieve():
  output = sieve(5)
  print(f"output = {sieve(5)}")
  print(f"verifying expression: {len(output) > 0}")
```

### Example Experiment Results

#### Output for Correct Code

```
output = [2, 3, 5]
verifying expression: True
```

#### Output for Mutant

```
output = []
verifying expression: False
```

### Example Conclusion

We see that the correct output contains "verifying expression: True", while the mutant output contains "verifying expression: False". This confirms my prediction, and shows that we have found inputs that let us detect the mutant. Therefore, I'm now ready to write the mutant killing test.

### Example Test

In our last experiment, we confirmed that calling `sieve(5)` lets us detect the mutant. Now we simply create a test using the verifying expression as an assertion.

```python
from sieve import sieve

def test__sieve():
    """Changing 'all' to 'any' in sieve would cause it to always return the empty list."""
    output = sieve(5)
    assert len(output) > 0, "sieve must detect prime numbers"
```

# Example Test Results

Your test correctly identified the mutant!

## Output for Correct Code

```

```

## Output for Mutant

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```
The test exited with exit code 1.

This is the end of the example session. Below, you will find the actual task:
