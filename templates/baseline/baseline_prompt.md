We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to write a test case that detects the mutant. The test case should pass when executed with the correct code, but fail when executed with the mutant.

- Output the test as single Python function called `test__<name>` with no parameters.
- Don't use any testing frameworks.
- Put your code in a markdown block and specify the language.
- Import all necessary files in your test code. You can assume that all python files we give you are in the root directory.
- Use assertions where appropriate.

Example:

```python
from sieve import sieve

def test_sieve()
    # test code here
```
