We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to use scientific debugging to gain an understanding of the mutant, and then write a test case that kills the mutant.

This is an automated process, consisting of a loop of "hypothesis", "experiment" and "conclusion" until you are ready to write a "test" or to declare the mutant "equivalent". During this loop, you will submit "experiment" code and "test" code, which our system is going to parse and then execute for you. Since your messages will be automatically parsed, pay close attention to the format we expect of your messages. This includes the markdown headlines (e.g., "# Experiment"). Do not write any markdown headlines other than the ones described below.


# Output Format

The process will use the following format:

    # Task
    (we will provide the code under test and the mutant)

    # Debugging

    ## Hypothesis
    (your hypothesis)

    ## Experiment
    (your experiment code and prediction)

    ### Experiment Results
    #### Running Experiment on Baseline
    (we will write the results)
    #### Running Experiment on Mutant
    (we will write the results)

    ## Conclusion
    (your conclusion)

    [repeat ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until you found inputs that can detect the mutant]

    ## Test
    (your mutant-killing test)

    ### Test Results
    #### Running Test on Baseline
    (we will give the results)
    #### Running Test on Mutant
    (we will give the results)

    [repeat ("Test") or ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until a test successfully killed the mutant]

    [at any point, if you believe the mutant to be equivalent to the original code]
    ## Equivalent Mutant
    (a short explanation about why the mutant is equivalent)

## Notes

Make sure that `## Experiment` is always followed by `### Experiment Results` and `## Test` is always followed by `## Test Results`. This is important for parsing your responses.


# Output Format for Code

Write all code in markdown code blocks and specify the language, e.g.:

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

Make sure to import all necessary functions in every code snippet. You can assume that all python files we list are in the current directory (`.`).

Output all code in single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters. Don't use any testing frameworks.

# Scientific Debugging

Scientific debugging is a systematic debugging approach based on the scientific method. The process follows a loop of:

- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

## Hypotheses

Each hypothesis should describe an assumption you have about the code. Hypotheses are the key aspect of scientific debugging, and should be written detailed and with great care.

- Base hypotheses on the findings of previous experiments.
- Don't repeat hypotheses you have already made.
- Don't base hypotheses on untested assumptions.

Hypotheses loosely follow this template: I hypothesize that [assumption] holds when [given inputs]. I predict that [assumed result] and I will verify this by [more explanation and experiment description].


## Experiments

After stating a hypothesis, you create an experiment to test it. Each experiment will contain a Python test case, that imports and calls the target code. Write the code like a normal unit test, but instead of using assertions, print out the results so you can see if your hypothesis is correct.

Each experiment should contain a relevant prediction based on your hypothesis and a way to verify that prediction based on the output. Basically, you run the target code and predict the output based on your hypothesis.

We will then take your test case, and
- execute it against the **Baseline**, i.e., the regular program without the mutant
- execute it against the **Mutant**, i.e., the program with the mutant in place.

Here is an example experiment:

```python
from sieve import sieve

def test__sieve():
    output = sieve(5)
    print(f"output = {correct_output}")
```

Running Experiment on Baseline
```
output = [2, 3, 5]
```

Running Experiment on Mutant
```
mutant output = []
```

Pay close attention to the output:
- Did the baseline have any errors? Does the experiment need to be fixed?
- Are there any discrepancies between the output of the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**? That means you detected mutant.

## Conclusions

After every experiment, write a conclusion that summarizes on the results. Summarize your conclusion in a short list, so you can refer back to them easily.

Next, keep creating hypotheses and experiments until you found inputs for which the mutant produces a different output than the correct implementation (exceptions and infinite loops also count). Once you found those inputs, and confirmed that they work, you can finish debugging and write the mutant-killing test.

## Tests

When you are ready, you will need to write a test that kills the mutant. Here is an example:

```python
from rpn_eval import rpn_eval

def test__rpn_eval():
    """
    Test whether operator argumenets are interpreted in the correct order. The input represents the calculation (8 / 2), which will lead to different results if the argument order is swapped, since (2 / 8) != (8 / 2).
    """
    output = rpn_eval([8.0, 2.0, '/'])
    assert output == 4.0
```

The test kills the mutant if, and only if, the test passes when executed with the *baseline* and fails when executed with the *mutant*.

Include a relevant docstring commnent with a summary of your findings. The comment should explain what the test checks for and why. Include relevant findings from your conclusions.

## Equivalent Mutants

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, meaning they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, write the `## Equivalent Mutant` headline and give a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Include some information from your experiments to back up your claims. Afterwards, continue with more experiments to c


Example:

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way [some result] is computed. My experiments show that [tried inputs] did not result in any different behavior in the mutant, which suggest [more explanation].

######## TODO: continue after equivalence is claimed



# Important Remarks

- Keep your experiments/tests short and simple.
- Use print statements liberally in your experiments/tests.
- Never recreate the code under test as part of your experiment/test.
- In your first experiment, always include a debugger script that prints interesting intermediate values. This helps you see what is happening inside the code.
- Some mutants can result in ininite loops or other timeouts. Therefore, please always print the results from the correct code before calling the mutant.

# Example Debugging

### Example Hypothesis

The mutant changes the if-condition on line 4 from `all` to `any`, which changes the prime number condition. Since the changed prime number condition is less strict, I hypothesize that this will cause the mutant output to include other numbers that are not prime.

### Example Experiment

To test my hypothesis, I will create an experiment that calls `sieve(5)`, then checks the output with the verifying expression `4 not in output` to test my prediction. My hypothesis is only confirmed if the verifying expression evaluates to True on the correct code.


To find out what is really happening, I will first run an experiment: I will call the function with a small `max` value and observe if the mutant will print different numbers than the correct code. I will also set a breakpoint on line 16 to print `n` and `primes` whenever a new prime number is appended.

```python
from sieve import sieve
from mutant.sieve import sieve as mutant_sieve

correct_output = sieve(5)
print(f"correct output = {correct_output}")

mutant_output = mutant_sieve(5)
print(f"mutant output = {mutant_output}")
```

```pdb
b sieve.py:16
commands
silent
print(f"correct code: n={n}, primes={primes}")
c
b mutant/sieve.py:16
commands
silent
print(f"mutant: n={n}, primes={primes}")
c
c
```

### Example Experiment Results

```
correct output = [2, 3, 5]
mutant output = []
```

correct code: n=3, primes=[2]
correct code: n=5, primes=[2, 3]
correct output = [2, 3, 5]
mutant output = []
The program exited.
```

### Example Conclusion

The mutant returned an empty list, while the correct code returned the expected prime numbers. This goes against my earlier prediction, as I predicted that the mutant would output more numbers.

In addition, the debugger output doesn't contain any prints from the mutant ("mutant: n={n}, primes={primes}"), while the correct debugger output contains prints from the breakpoint (e.g., "correct code: n=2, primes=[]"). This confirms that the breakpoint on line 16 works, and shows us that the mutant did not execute line 16.

In conclusion, I learned:
  - The mutant returned an empty list `[]` instead of the expected prime numbers `[2, 3, 5]`
  - The mutant did not execute line 16.

### Example Hypothesis

Since `sieve(5)` returned `[]` with the mutant and `[2, 3, 5]` with the correct code, I have already found a difference, that I can exploit for a test case.

Before I create the test, I should confirm my findings with an experiment. I hypothesize that, when calling `sieve(5)`, the mutant will return an empty list `[]`, while the correct code will return a list that is not empty.

### Example Experiment

To test my hypothesis, I will create an experiment that calls `sieve(5)`, then checks the output with the verifying expression `len(output) > 0` to test my prediction. My hypothesis is only confirmed if the verifying expression evaluates to True on the correct code.

There is no need to use the debugger in this experiment, since I'm re-using the same inputs from the last experiment. This means that the output from the breakpoints would stay the same.

```python
from sieve import sieve
from mutant.sieve import sieve as mutant_sieve

correct_output = sieve(5)
print(f"correct output = {correct_output}")
print(f"correct verifying expression = {len(correct_output) > 0}")

mutant_output = mutant_sieve(5)
print(f"mutant output = {mutant_output}")
print(f"mutant verifying expression = {len(mutant_output) > 0}")
```

### Example Experiment Results

```
correct output = [2, 3, 5]
correct verifying expression = True
mutant output = []
mutant verifying expression = False
```

### Example Experiment Conclusion

I see that the correct output contains "verifying expression: True", while the mutant output contains "verifying expression: False". This confirms my prediction, and shows that I have found inputs that let me detect the mutant. Therefore, I'm now ready to write the mutant killing test.

### Example Test

In our last experiment, I confirmed that calling `sieve(5)` lets me detect the mutant. Now I simply create a test using the verifying expression as an assertion.

```python
from sieve import sieve

def test__sieve():
    """Changing 'all' to 'any' in sieve would cause it to always return the empty list."""
    output = sieve(5)
    assert len(output) > 0, "sieve must detect prime numbers"
```

# Example Test Results

Your test correctly identified the mutant!

## Output for Correct Code

## Output for Mutant

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```
The test exited with exit code 1.

This is the end of the example session. Below, you will find the actual task:
