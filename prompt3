Hypothesis:

The mutant replaces the call to `all()` on line 14 with a call to `any()`. Since the function implements the sieve of
eratosthenes, `all(n % p > 0 for p in primes)` needs to check whether `n` is divisible by any primes that have
already been found. After changing `all()` to `any()`, I hypothesize that the mutated function will not just output the prime numbers,
but also also include numbers that are indivisible by any previous prime number.

Prediction:

We need to find a number that is not prime, but indivisible by a prime smaller than it.
The number 4 is not prime but is indivisible by 3, so it matches the description.
So, to verify my hypothesis, I will check whether 4 is contained in the output of `sieve(5)`.
I will use the expression `4 not in sieve(5)`, which should evaluate to True on the correct version and False on the mutant.
I will also print the output to gather more information.

Experiment:

```python
print(sieve(10))  # print output
print(4 not in sieve(10))  # verifying expression
```

Experiment Results:

Test on correct code:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 1, in <module>
    print(sieve(10))
          ^^^^^
NameError: name 'sieve' is not defined
```

Test on mutant:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 1, in <module>
    print(sieve(10))
          ^^^^^
NameError: name 'sieve' is not defined
```

Conclusion:

The test code failed on both versions, because an import was missing.
Therefore, the hypothesis is still undecided.
I will add the import to the test code and try again.

Hypothesis:

Same hypothesis as before.

Prediction:

Same prediction as before.

Experiment:

```python
from sieve import sieve

print(sieve(10))  # print output
print(4 not in sieve(10))  # verifying expression
```

Experiment Result:

Test on correct version:
```
[2, 3, 5]
True
```

Test on buggy version:
```
[]
True
```

Conclusion:

I predicted that `4 not in sieve(5)` will evaluate to False on the mutant, but it evaluated to True.
This means that the hypothesis is incorrect.

Hypothesis:

The last experiment showed that the mutated function returned an empty list `[]`. A possible explanation could be that the `any()`
function always returns False when called with an empty list, so no number ever gets appended to the list.
Therefore, I hypothesize that the `append()` function on line 15 is never called for the mutant.

Prediction:

I need to check if line 15 of the mutated function gets executed at all. To do so, I use the debugger and set a breakpoint on line 15.
The breakpoint should be hit on the correct function, but not on the mutated function.
To make sure that the "max" parameter did not effect the outcome, I will choose a larger max of 100 instead of 5.

Experiment:

```python
from sieve import sieve

sieve(100)
```

```debugger
b sieve.py:15
c
```

Experiment Result:

Test on correct code:
```
```

Test on mutant:
```
```

Debugger on correct code:
```
> test.py(1)<module>()
-> from sieve import sieve
(Pdb) b sieve.py:15
Breakpoint 1 at sieve.py:15
(Pdb) c
> sieve.py(15)sieve()
-> primes.append(n)
(Pdb)
The program exited.
```

Debugger on mutant:
```
> test.py(1)<module>()
-> from sieve import sieve
(Pdb) b sieve.py:15
Breakpoint 1 at sieve.py:15
(Pdb) c
The program exited.
```

Conclusion:

The debugger indeed hit the breakpoint on the correct version, but not on the mutant. This means that the hypothesis is
correct.

<DEBUGGING_DONE>

Next, I will write a test that detects the mutant. I will use the following template:
```python
from sieve import sieve

def test_sieve():
    pass  # test here
```

But first, I will explain the test:
The mutated function will always return an empty list, so the test can simply check the length of the returned result to
detect the mutant.

```python
from sieve import sieve

def test_sieve():
    assert len(sieve(5)) > 0, 'sieve should return at least one prime number'
```
