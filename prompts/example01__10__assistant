The mutated function will always return an empty list, since it never appends any numbers to it.
The test case can simply check the length of the returned result to detect the mutant.

```python
from sieve import sieve

def test_sieve():
    assert len(sieve(5)) > 0, 'sieve should return at least one prime number'
```
