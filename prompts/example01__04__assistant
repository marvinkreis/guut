The test code failed on both versions, because an import was missing.
Therefore, the hypothesis is still undecided.
I will add the import to the test code and try again.

Hypothesis:

Same hypothesis as before.

Prediction:

Same prediction as before.

Experiment:

```python
from sieve import sieve

print(sieve(10))  # print output
print(4 not in sieve(10))  # verifying expression
```
